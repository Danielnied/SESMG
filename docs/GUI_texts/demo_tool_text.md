## Welcome using the Demo Tool of the Spreadsheet Energy System Model Generator (SESMG)
### Demo Energy System
<div style="text-align: justify">
In this demo the financial costs and carbon dioxide emissions of a residential 
area are simulated. For improvement, the technologies listed below are 
available with the parameters below. The simulated scenarios can be compared 
with the status quo, the financial minimum and the emission minimum.  
The urban area of a fictitious city to be optimized comprises 15 000 
inhabitants. The annual heat demand of 52 000 MWh/a is currently provided by 
24 MW gas heating systems. Annually, 14 000 MWh of electricity are purchased 
via the electricity wholesale market.  
Which of the technologies on the left would you incorporate and how 
would you dimension them into the energy system to minimize the current cost 
of 13.7 Mil. â‚¬/a and/or CO2 emissions of 17 200 t/a?  
Type in your solution on the left side and get it simulated!
