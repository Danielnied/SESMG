4a. Download CBC solver here: `CBC solver for windows <https://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/Cbc/>`_. Alternatively you can uses the `direct download link <https://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/Cbc/Cbc-2.10-win64-msvc16-mdd.zip>`_

The gurobi solver may be used as **alternative** to the cbc-solver. Be aware, that the gurobi-solver is not open-source and a license is required. However, the gurobi may be faster for certain types of optimization problems, especially for those containing binary decisions. The installation procedure of the gurobi solver is described in detail here: https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/quickstart.html


5. Execute the windows_installation.cmd and add your python version (for me the installation took 6 minutes).

MacOS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Install Python (version 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9) 


.. note:: 

	Make sure to select "Add pyton to PATH" at the beginning of the Python installation.


- go to the `Python download page <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_
- chose a Python version (e.g., "Python 3.7.6") and click "download"
- download an installer (e.g., "Python 3.7.6 macOS 64-bit installer")
- execute the installer on your computer
	
During this step, the cbc solver was automatically isntalled. The gurobi solver may be used as **alternative** to the cbc-solver. Be aware, that the gurobi-solver is not open-source and a license is required. However, the gurobi may be faster for certain types of optimization problems, especially for those containing binary decisions. The installation procedure of the gurobi solver is described in detail here: https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/quickstart.html


2. Download the Spreadsheet Energy System Model Generator from `GIT <https://github.com/chrklemm/SESMG/tree/master>`_ as .zip folder.


3. Extract the .zip folder into any directory on the computer.

.. note:: 

	If your device does not have homebrew installed, install it by typing ``/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`` in your terminal.
	
4. Excecute the "MacOS_installation.command" file.

5. The Spreadsheet Energy System Model Generator has been installed.

Linux 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Install Python (version 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9)

- go to `<https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-ubuntu/>`_
- use Python3.7 instead of Python3.8

.. note::
	
	Make sure that the alias python3 is set to Python3.7.x.
	If not use update-alternatives to change it and test ist afterwards.
	
1.1 Update alternatives:

``$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.7 2``

1.2 Testing:

``$ python3 --version``
	 
2. Download the Spreadsheet Energy System Model Generator from `GIT <https://github.com/chrklemm/SESMG/tree/master>`_ as .zip folder.

3. Extract the .zip folder into any directory on the computer.

4. Install PIP 

``$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip``

5. Install tkinter 

``$ sudo apt-get install python3.7-tk``
	
6. Install Graphviz

``$ sudo apt-get install graphviz``
	
7. Install the CBC-Solver 

``$ sudo apt-get install coinor-cbc``

The gurobi solver may be used as **alternative** to the cbc-solver. Be aware, that the gurobi-solver is not open-source and a license is required. However, the gurobi may be faster for certain types of optimization problems, especially for those containing binary decisions. The installation procedure of the gurobi solver is described in detail here: https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/quickstart.html
	
8. Execute the "Linux_installtion.sh" file. By first going to the path of the SESMG directory and then running the following:

``$ sudo sh Linux_installation.sh``

9. The Spreadsheet Energy System Model Generator has been installed.
